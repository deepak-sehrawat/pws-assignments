    "# Grid Search Cross-Validation (GridSearchCV) is a hyperparameter tuning technique in machine learning that helps find the best set of hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but need to be set before training a model. Examples include the learning rate in a model, the depth of a decision tree, or the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm. The purpose of GridSearchCV is to systematically explore a predefined set of hyperparameter combinations to determine the combination that results in the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's how GridSearchCV works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Define Hyperparameter Grid: we start by defining a grid of hyperparameters to search over. For each hyperparameter, we specify a range of values or a list of possible choices. For example, we might define a grid for a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with hyperparameters like kernel type, C (regularization parameter), and gamma. The grid could look like this:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    # - Kernel: ['linear', 'poly', 'rbf']\n",
    "    # - C: [0.1, 1, 10]\n",
    "    # - Gamma: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Cross-Validation: GridSearchCV uses k-fold cross-validation to evaluate each combination of hyperparameters. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k subsets (folds). The model is trained and evaluated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once, and the rest as the training set.This helps to reduce the impact of randomness in the data and provides a more robust estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Model Training and Evaluation: For each combination of hyperparameters, GridSearchCV fits a model on the training data for each fold and evaluates its performance on the corresponding test fold. It computes a performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, or mean squared error) for each fold and then calculates the average performance across all folds. This average performance metric is used to compare different hyperparameter combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Select the Best Hyperparameters: After evaluating all combinations, GridSearchCV identifies the hyperparameter combination that resulted in the best average performance. This combination is selected as the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Model Fitting: Finally, GridSearchCV fits the model using the selected hyperparameters on the entire dataset (or a user-defined training set) to obtain the final model.\n",

    "# Grid Search CV (GridSearchCV) and Randomized Search CV (RandomizedSearchCV) are both techniques for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. They aim to find the best set of hyperparameters for a model, but they differ in how they explore the hyperparameter space. Here are the key differences and when to choose one over the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Grid Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 1. Exploration Method: Grid Search CV exhaustively searches through all possible combinations of hyperparameters in a predefined grid. It evaluates every combination, making it a systematic approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Search Space: It's suitable for a relatively small search space or when we have a good idea of the hyperparameters that might perform well. Grid Search explicitly specifies values to test for each hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 3. Computational Cost: Grid Search CV can be computationally expensive, especially when the hyperparameter grid is large, as it evaluates all possible combinations. This makes it slower when we have many hyperparameters or a large dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 4. Guaranteed Results: It guarantees finding the best hyperparameters within the specified grid but may not be the most efficient choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 1. Exploration Method: Randomized Search CV, as the name suggests, explores the hyperparameter space randomly. It randomly samples combinations from the defined search space, making it a more stochastic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Search Space: It is better suited for larger search spaces or when we have limited prior knowledge about which hyperparameters are likely to work well. It allows us to sample from a distribution of values for each hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 3. Computational Cost: Randomized Search CV is generally faster because it evaluates a random subset of the hyperparameter space. we can control the number of iterations, so it's more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 4. Efficiency: While Randomized Search does not guarantee finding the absolute best hyperparameters, it's often more efficient in practice because it explores a broader range of possibilities and may discover good hyperparameter combinations faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When to Choose One Over the Other:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 1. Grid Search CV: Choose Grid Search CV when we have a small search space, or we have prior knowledge about the hyperparameters that are likely to work well. It's also a good choice when we need to guarantee finding the best hyperparameters, even if it comes at the cost of longer computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Randomized Search CV: Opt for Randomized Search CV when we have a larger or less well-understood search space. It's a more efficient option when we have limited computational resources and want to quickly explore a wide range of hyperparameters. It's often used in scenarios where we want to find \"good enough\" hyperparameters without exhaustively searching all possibilities.\n"

    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "    # supose we're building a loan default prediction model. Properly splitting our data for training and testing is crucial. Data leakage happens if test data accidentally ends up in the training set, making the model learn from information it shouldn't have access to.
