It provides information about how well the independent variable(s) in the model explain the variability in the dependent variable. In simpler terms, R-squared helps us understand how closely the predicted values from the regression model match the actual observed values.\n",

    "    # R^2 = 1 - (SSR / SST)\n",

    "# 2. Interpretation of R-squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # - R-squared values range from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # - An R-squared value of 0 indicates that the independent variable(s) in the model do not explain any of the variability in the dependent variable. In other words, the model does not fit the data at all.\n",

Here's how adjusted R-squared differs from the regular R-squared:\n",
