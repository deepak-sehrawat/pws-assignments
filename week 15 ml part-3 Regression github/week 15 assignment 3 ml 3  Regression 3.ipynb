    "\n",
    "    # 1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) is assumed to be linear. Ridge Regression, like OLS, models this linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) in the model should be independent of each other. In other words, the error associated with one data point should not depend on the errors of other data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 3. No or Little Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression is often used when there is multicollinearity among the independent variables. However, it assumes that multicollinearity is present but manageable, as Ridge Regression is designed to address it by shrinking the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 4. Normality of Errors: Ridge Regression, like OLS, assumes that the errors are normally distributed. This assumption is more critical when making statistical inferences or constructing confidence intervals. However, Ridge Regression can still be effective even if this assumption is not perfectly met, as it primarily focuses on improving model stability and reducing overfitting."
