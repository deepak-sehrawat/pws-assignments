    "        \n",
    "  #  - Definition:\n",
    "          #  Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical data has an inherent order or ranking among its values.\n",
    "  #  - Example:\n",
    "          #  Consider a dataset of education levels with categories like \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"Ph.D.\" In this case, there is a clear order, where \"Ph.D.\" is higher than \"Master's Degree,\" which is higher than \"Bachelor's Degree,\" and so on.\n",
    "  #  - Encoding:\n",
    "          #  You assign numerical values to the categories based on their order. For example, you could encode \"High School\" as 1, \"Bachelor's Degree\" as 2, \"Master's Degree\" as 3, and \"Ph.D.\" as 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #  Ordinal encoding preserves the order of the categories and is suitable when there is a meaningful rank or hierarchy in the data.\n",

    "# 2. Label Encoding:\n",
    "        \n",
    "  #  - Definition:\n",
    "          #  Label encoding is used when the categorical data has no inherent order, and you simply want to convert the categories into numerical labels.\n",
    "  #  - Example:\n",
    "          #  Suppose you have a dataset of car colors with categories like \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" \"Green,\" and \"Yellow.\" In this case, there is no intrinsic order among these colors.\n",
    "  #  - Encoding:\n",
    "          #  Label encoding assigns a unique integer to each category, such as \"Red\" as 1, \"Blue\" as 2, \"Green\" as 3, and \"Yellow\" as 4.\n",
    "\n",

    "# # Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a method of encoding categorical variables where the labels (categories) are assigned numerical values based on their relationship with the target variable. It's a technique commonly used in machine learning projects, particularly for classification tasks, when dealing with categorical features that have an ordinal nature but also have a strong correlation with the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate Mean/Median/Any Aggregation by Group: For each category within the categorical feature, you calculate an aggregated statistic based on the target variable. This statistic could be the mean, mode, median, or any other suitable aggregation function. The choice of aggregation function depends on the problem and the nature of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort Categories by the Aggregated Values: Once you have the aggregated values for each category, you sort the categories based on these values in ascending or descending order. This sorting represents the ordinal relationship between the categories in terms of their impact on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assign Ordinal Labels: Finally, you assign ordinal labels to the categories based on their position in the sorted list. The category with the highest aggregated value typically gets the highest label, and the one with the lowest value gets the lowest label.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's an example of when we might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project:\n",
    "\n",
    "# EXAMPLE: we are working on a credit risk prediction project, where you have a dataset of loan applications. One of the categorical features in the dataset is \"Credit Score Range,\" which indicates the range of the applicant's credit score (e.g., \"Poor,\" \"Fair,\" \"Good,\" \"Excellent\"). You know that applicants with higher credit scores are less likely to default on loans, and you want to capture this ordinal relationship while encoding this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the mean default rate for each credit score range. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Poor: 0.25 (25% default rate)\n",

    "# Good: 0.10 (10% default rate)\n",
    "# Excellent: 0.05 (5% default rate)\n",

    "# Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two random variables change together. In other words, it measures the joint variability of two variables. Specifically, covariance indicates whether an increase in one variable corresponds to an increase or a decrease in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Definition of Covariance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# For two random variables X and Y, the covariance between them is denoted as Cov(X, Y).\n",
    "# The formula for calculating covariance between two variables X and Y for a sample of data points (x_i, y_i) is as follows: Cov(X, Y) = Σ [(x_i - u_X) * (y_i - u_Y)] / (n - 1)\n",

    "# Importance in Statistical Analysis:\n",

    "# Covariance is crucial in statistical analysis for several reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "# a. Relationship Assessment:\n",
    "#      Covariance indicates the nature of the relationship between two variables. A positive covariance suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, while a negative covariance suggests that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. \n",
    "# b. Scale Independence:\n",
    "#      Covariance is not affected by the scale of the variables. This means that it's useful for comparing the relationships between variables, even if they are measured in different units. \n",
    "# c. Data Exploration:\n",
    "#      Covariance can help researchers and data analysts identify patterns and associations in data, providing insights into potential cause-and-effect relationships. \n",

    "#     b. For each data point (x_i, y_i), compute the deviation from the mean for both X and Y: (x_i - u_X) and (y_i - u_Y). \n",
    "#     c. Multiply these deviations for each data point: (x_i - u_X) * (y_i - u_Y). \n",
    "#     d. Sum up all these products for all data points. \n",
    "#     e. Finally, divide the sum by (n - 1), where n is the number of data points, to get the covariance.\n",
