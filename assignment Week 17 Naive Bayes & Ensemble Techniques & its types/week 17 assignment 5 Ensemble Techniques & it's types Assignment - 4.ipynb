    "# The main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Ensemble vs. Single Tree:\n",
    "    #- Random Forest Regressor: It is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions.\n",
    "    #- Decision Tree Regressor: It is a single decision tree model that makes predictions based on the structure of a single tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Handling Overfitting:\n",
    "    #- Random Forest Regressor: It mitigates overfitting by building multiple trees on different subsets of the data and averaging their predictions, which reduces variance and improves generalization.\n",
    "    #- Decision Tree Regressor: It is more prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees, as it tries to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",

    "    #- Random Forest Regressor: It introduces randomness by training each tree on a random subset of the data and considering only a random subset of features at each split.\n",
    "    #- Decision Tree Regressor: It makes splits based on the features that optimize certain criteria (e.g., reducing variance), without introducing randomness in the feature selection process.\n",

    "# 4. Predictive Performance:\n",
    "    #- Random Forest Regressor: It often achieves higher predictive performance and generalization on unseen data compared to Decision Tree Regressor, especially when dealing with complex datasets.\n",
    "    #- Decision Tree Regressor: Its performance may vary depending on the depth of the tree and the complexity of the dataset. It can be sensitive to outliers and noisy data.\n",

    "    #- Random Forest Regressor: It may be less interpretable compared to a single decision tree because it involves multiple trees and aggregation of predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "    # 1. Less Interpretable: Random Forest Regressor is less interpretable compared to single decision trees, as it involves an ensemble of trees and the aggregation of predictions, making it challenging to understand the decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 2. Computational Complexity: Building and training multiple decision trees can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets with many features and trees. However, this can be mitigated by parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 3. Memory Consumption: Random Forest Regressor requires storing multiple decision trees in memory, which can lead to high memory consumption, particularly for large forests with deep trees.\n",
